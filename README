Common errors while running 'make test':
* environment variable PASSWORD should be set
* test script asks for confirmation if the remote host is tested. To resolve
  this, ssh manually once to both webserver and tapas.
* If some compute.c tests take too long, reduce their size by editing
  compute.c. You will find comments of the type '//fast' which contain
  smaller runs of the same benchmarks.
